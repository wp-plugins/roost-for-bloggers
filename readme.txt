= Using Features =

**Auto Push**
Auto Push is what makes this plugin stellar. When you create a new post, your post's title and link will be sent to all of your subscribed readers. That's it. Really. You don't have to do anything else. (It works just like magic.)

**Safari Web Push**
To use Safari Web Push, simply activate the *Roost for Bloggers* plugin. When your site is viewed in a push-enabled browser and a Roost button or bar is clicked, the browser will prompt for permission. No additional setup is needed.

**Use Custom Text**
When enabled, the text you enter here will be attached to the auto-pushed messages. You can choose to place this text before or after the auto message.

**Send Manual Alert**
You can send a manual alert to all subscribed users by entering your message text in the "Message" box and a link in the "Link" box.

**Roost Buttons**
Two button types are provided, a social-style button and a mobile-style button. These need to be manually put into your theme templates or used on individual posts. We tried to make it as easy as possible...

To use the Roost social button, simply place this shortcode into your content:
[Roost]

The mobile style button is generated by using this shortcode:
[RoostMobile]

**Roost Analytics & Roost JS**
Detailed metrics are provided in the Roost dashboard about your subscribers. These metrics include reads, pages view, messages received, and time on site.

**Notes**
To use any of the integrated registration options below, you will need to be using a Wordpress template that generates the *Content* section on pages. If you use a *static* page, such as a custom homepage, you will need to manually insert the empty containers. The Roost JS is inserted into the footer via the *wp_footer()* function. If your theme does not use this function, you will need to manually copy / paste the Roost JS code snippet.

**Roost Header / Footer Bar**
To enable the Roost Header / Footer bar, select it from the dropdown in the registration section of the Roost dashboard. A *Custom Text* box will appear. Here you are able to customize the text that is displayed on the bar.

**Custom Registration**
If you would like to handle your own registration code, choose this method. Anything you put in this box will be inserted into the *Content* section of each page.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do subscribers have to download the Roost mobile app? =
In order for a device to receive a true push notification, a native mobile app must be installed. That's where Roost comes in. We are there to provide that *native bridge.* We do not pull readers into our app, but push them back to your website. Notifications also stay in the Roost app, which makes them able to be viewed at any time.

= Do my readers / subscribers have to create an account with Roost? =
Nope. We have a patent-pending *zero-configuration* installation process for the Roost app. When a person hits your subscription link, the are sent to the Roost page on their device's app store, and prompted for install. Once installed and opened, a person is sent directly back to the page they were viewing on your site.

= Is Roost only for iOS (or only for Android) =
Roost is available for both Apple iOS and Google Android.

= What does Roost For Bloggers cost? =
It's free!

= Free? Really? What's the catch? =
No catch! We believe in providing a great service and making it accessible to everyone. So... It's free. (Up to 1,000,000 messages. If you hit that... We'll need to talk.)
